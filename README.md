# 8051-sound-application

This repository is extension of a project undertaken in Electronic's Engineering Undergraduate course. The project describes a mini piano based on 8051 micro controller to check the efficiency of using 8051 in sound based applications. It uses embedded c programming to ensure that different frequency is generated the press of an individual button. The flowchart for the logic is as follows
